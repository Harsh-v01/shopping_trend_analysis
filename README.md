# Sales Trend Prediction and Customer Behavior Analysis

This project implements a machine learning-based system to predict sales trends and identify customer behavior patterns using data from various sources, including e-commerce platforms, retail stores, and social media.

## Features
- Collects data from e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart), retail store sales records, customer reviews, and social media trends.
- Performs data preprocessing such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
- Conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations like heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Implements machine learning models for clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) to segment customers based on shopping behavior.
- Uses time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future sales trends.
- Visualizes insights through interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau and Power BI.
